The violent assault, which occurred on a busy Friday evening, claimed the life of a woman and left her male companion fighting for his life in hospital.\\n\\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the victims, both in their early thirties, were enjoying what appeared to be a romantic dinner date at the upscale Italian eatery \"La Trattoria\" on George Street when the attack unfolded. At approximately 8:45 PM, a man allegedly burst into the restaurant brandishing a large kitchen knife and immediately targeted the couple seated near the window.\\n\\nIn a frenzy of violence that lasted less than a minute, the assailant repeatedly stabbed both victims before other patrons and staff could intervene. The female victim, identified as 32-year-old Sarah Thompson, a local marketing executive, suffered multiple stab wounds to her chest and neck. Despite the best efforts of first responders, she was pronounced dead at the scene.\\n\\nHer companion, 34-year-old James Wilson, a software engineer, was rushed to St. Vincent\\'s Hospital with life-threatening injuries. He remains in critical condition after undergoing emergency surgery for stab wounds to his abdomen and upper body.\\n\\nThe alleged attacker, now identified as 36-year-old Michael Brennan, was quickly subdued by two off-duty police officers who happened to be dining at the restaurant. Brennan, who reportedly showed signs of extreme agitation and possible intoxication, was arrested at the scene and taken into custody.\\n\\nAs news of the attack spread, shocked diners and passersby gathered outside the cordoned-off restaurant, many visibly shaken by the night\\'s events. One witness, who asked to remain anonymous, described the scene as \"something out of a horror movie.\"\\n\\n\"I was walking past when I heard screaming coming from inside,\" the witness recounted. \"Then I saw this man covered in blood being tackled by two other guys. It was absolute chaos.\"\\n\\nThe incident has raised concerns about public safety and the seemingly random nature of the attack. Detective Inspector Sarah Lowe of the New South Wales Police Force addressed these concerns in a press conference held early Saturday morning.\\n\\n\"At this stage, we believe this to be an isolated incident,\" Detective Inspector Lowe stated. \"Our initial investigations suggest that the alleged perpetrator did not know the victims and that this was a random act of violence. We are exploring all possible motives, including mental health issues and substance abuse.\"\\n\\nThe restaurant owner, Antonio Rossi, expressed his deep sorrow and shock at the events that unfolded in his establishment. \"In thirty years of running restaurants, I have never experienced anything like this,\" Rossi said, his voice choked with emotion. \"My heart goes out to the victims and their families. We are cooperating fully with the police investigation.\"\\n\\nAs the community grapples with the aftermath of this tragedy, local authorities have announced increased patrols in the area to reassure the public. Mental health support services have also been made available for witnesses and those affected by the incident.\\n\\nThe charged man, Michael Brennan, is due to appear in Sydney Central Local Court on Monday. If convicted, he faces a potential life sentence for murder and up to 25 years for attempted murder under New South Wales law.\\n\\nThis horrific attack serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of violence and the importance of public vigilance. As Sydney residents come to terms with this tragedy, many are left questioning the safety of public spaces and the randomness with which lives can be irrevocably altered in mere moments.\\n\\nThe incident has also sparked renewed debates about knife crime and mental health support in Australia, with advocacy groups calling for stricter laws and better access to mental health services. As the investigation continues and more details emerge, the city of Sydney mourns the loss of a young life and hopes for the recovery of the surviving victim.', 'Let\\'s approach this task step-by-step:\\n\\nStep 1: Identify the key components of the review\\nThe review consists of two main parts:\\na) \"very predictable\"\\nb) \"but still entertaining\"\\n\\nStep 2: Analyze the sentiment of each component\\na) \"very predictable\" - This is generally considered a negative aspect in movies, as audiences often prefer surprising or original plots.\\nb) \"but still entertaining\" - This is a positive aspect, indicating that despite the predictability, the viewer still enjoyed the movie.\\n\\nStep 3: Consider the conjunction \"but\"\\nThe use of \"but\" is crucial here. It indicates a contrast between the two parts of the sentence, suggesting that the second part (entertaining) overrides or mitigates the first part (predictable).\\n\\nStep 4: Weigh the overall sentiment\\nWhile the review acknowledges a negative aspect (predictability), it ultimately concludes with a positive statement (entertaining). The use of \"but still\" suggests that the entertainment value outweighs the predictability.\\n\\nStep 5: Make a final judgment\\nBased on the analysis, this review leans more towards being positive. The reviewer found the movie entertaining despite its predictability, which suggests an overall positive experience.\\n\\nConclusion: This movie review sentence is positive.\\n\\nJustification: Although the review mentions a negative aspect (predictability), the overall sentiment is positive because:\\n1. The reviewer still found the movie entertaining.\\n2. The use of \"but still\" indicates that the positive aspect (entertainment) supersedes the negative aspect (predictability).\\n3. The review ends on a positive note, which often carries more weight in determining overall sentiment.']\n",

Title: The review is titled \"awful,\" which immediately sets a negative tone and clearly expresses the customer\\'s overall opinion of the book.\\n\\n2. Opening statement: \"I really expected better\" shows that the customer\\'s expectations were not met, leading to disappointment.\\n\\n3. Direct criticism: The reviewer states, \"This was a horrible book,\" leaving no ambiguity about their opinion.\\n\\n4. Character critique: The customer expresses strong disapproval of the main character\\'s portrayal, particularly her sympathies towards the enslaver of her own family and her ridicule of her mother\\'s stance against slavery.\\n\\n5. Author criticism: The reviewer accuses the author, Julius Lester, of trying too hard to present an unusual viewpoint, resulting in what they perceive as a distorted and offensive narrative.\\n\\n6. Plot and character development concerns: The customer is clearly unhappy with how the Pharaoh is portrayed as kind and wise, how the main character is presented as a heroine despite turning her back on her family and people, and how the Jewish slaves are depicted as \"crazy, prejudiced people.\"\\n\\n7. Emotional response: The use of \"Honestly!\" at the end of the review conveys exasperation and disbelief, further emphasizing the customer\\'s negative reaction to the book.\\n\\n8. Lack of positive comments: Notably, the review does not mention any redeeming qualities or positive aspects of the book, which is indicative of a thoroughly unsatisfactory experience.\\n\\n9. Strong language: The use of words like \"horrible\" and \"awful\" leaves no doubt about the intensity of the customer\\'s dissatisfaction.\\n\\n10. Ethical concerns: The reviewer seems particularly upset by the book\\'s treatment of sensitive historical and moral issues, such as slavery and cultural identity, which have clearly offended their sensibilities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this review unequivocally demonstrates that the customer was highly dissatisfied with the product. The tone, content, and language used throughout the review all point to a deeply negative experience with the book, with no apparent silver linings or positive aspects mentioned. The customer\\'s expectations were not only unmet but seemingly violated on multiple levels, including plot, character development, historical accuracy, and moral messaging.', \"It 's part of the partisan bickering that comes with a two party system .

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
